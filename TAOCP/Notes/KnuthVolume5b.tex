\noindent {\bf Timing tests}

I implemented the N-Queens algorithms, including the optimizations
discussed in the problems, in c++ and timed their performance using
Google Benchmark.  The four methods were a  unoptimized
version, the array version of the basic algorithm~B, the
same version modified to use bit twiddling instead of arrays,
and Walkers version.  The execution time runs in the ratio
22:6.3:6.6:1.  So bit twiddling is not helpful, but, unsurprisingly,
Walkers method is by far the fastest.
