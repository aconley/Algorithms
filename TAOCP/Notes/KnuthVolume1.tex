\noindent {\bf Algorithm A} ({\it Multiplication of Permutations}).
A key point about Algorithm A is that the step {\bf A4},
{\bf A5} combo wraps entirely.  So in many cases {\tt CURRENT} will
re-encounter itself.  This is actually critical for the final occurance of
any symbol -- it has to be able to find the next element.  

For example,
consider $\left(a c f\right)\left(b d\right)$.  Pretty quickly, one gets
{\tt START} $\gets a$, {\tt CURRENT} $\gets c$.  But there is only one $c$
in the formula, so what happens is that the code progresses to the right,
hits the end, outputs $c$, and then wraps around until it runs into the 
{\it same} $c$.  It then tags that $c$ and sets {\tt CURRENT} $\gets f$.

\noindent {\bf Algorithm B} ({\it Multiplication of Permutations})
Try a different (slightly simpler) example:
the product of $\left(a b d\right) \left(e f\right)$ and 
$\left(a c f\right)\left(b d\right)$ (this comes from problems 3 and 4
of the exercises).  We have $n = 6$, so we need $T\left[1\right] \ldots T\left[6\right]$.

\noindent {\bf B1:} $T \gets {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$. \hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} The element is ``)", so $Z \gets 0$ and repeat.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} The element is ``d", corresponding to $x_4$, so $i = 4$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B3:} Exchange $Z$ and $T\left[4\right]$, so we now have
 $T = {1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6}$ and $Z = 4$.  We have made $T\left[i\right] = 0$,
  so $j \gets 4$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} The next element is ``b", and so $i \gets 2$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B3:} Exchange $Z$ and $T\left[2\right]$, so that
 $Z = 2$ and $T = {1, 4, 3, 0, 5, 6}$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} The next element is ``(", so jump to {\bf B4}.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B4:} Set $T\left[j\right] \gets Z$, so $T = {1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6}$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} It's a ``)" so $Z \gets 0$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} It's a ``f'', so $i \gets 6$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B3:} Exchange $Z$ and $T\left[6\right]$, giving
 $T = {1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 0}$, $Z = 6$, and set $j \gets 6$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} It's a ``c", so $i \gets 3$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B3:} $Z \gets 3$, $T = {1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0}$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} It's a ``a", so $i \gets 1$\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B3:} $Z \gets 1$, $T = {3, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0}$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} It's a ``(", so on to {\bf B4}.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B4:} Now set $T\left[6\right] \gets Z$, so
 $T = {3, 4, 6, 2, 5, 1}.$
At this point we have written $\left(a c f\right)\left( b d \right)$ into $T$
as $a \to c$, $b \to d$, $c \to f$, $d \to b$, $e \to e$, $f \to a$ -- which
is correct. Now we will start the actual product. \hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} $Z \gets 0$, then repeat to get $i \gets 6$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B3:} $Z = 1$, $T = 3, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0$ and $j \gets 6$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2, B3:} $i \gets 5$, $Z \gets 5$, $T = 3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 0$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2:} It's a ``('', so to {\bf B4}.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B4:} $T = 3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 5$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2, B2, B3:} $Z \gets 0$, then $i \gets 4$, then $T = 3, 4, 6, 0, 1, 5$
and $j \gets 4$ and $Z \gets 2$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2, B3:} $i \gets 2$, $Z \gets 4$, $T = 3, 2, 6, 0, 1, 5$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B2, B3:} $i \gets 1$, $Z \gets 3$, $T = 4, 2, 6, 0, 1, 5$.\hfil\break
\noindent {\bf B4:} Finally, $T\left[j\right] \gets Z$ for the last modification, giving
$T = 4, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5$, or $a \to d$, $b \to b$, $c \to f$, $d \to c$, $e \to a$, and
$f \to e$, which is correct.

Indeed, at every point as we sweep from right to left, $T$ represents all the
product to the right of the current point.

\noindent {\bf Algorithm A} ({\it Addition of Polynomials}).  Doing the suggested example,
which is $x + y - z$ added to $x^2 - 2 y - z$.  The first ({\tt P}) is represented
by a list with {\tt COEF}s 1, 1, 1, and {\tt ABC} values 100, 010, 001.  The second
has {\tt COEF}s 1, -2, -1, and {\tt ABC} values 200, 010, 001.

So, after step {\bf A1}, we will have {\tt P} pointing at the $x$ term, {\tt Q} pointing
at the $x^2$ term, and {\tt Q1} on the terminator node.  At {\bf A2} we have
${\tt ABC(P)} < {\tt ABC(Q)}$, with values 100 and 200, respectively, so move the
{\tt Q} pointers along so that {\tt Q} points at {\tt COEF} 010 and {\tt Q1} at the
$x^2$ term.  What is happening is that {\tt P} doesn't have a $x^2$ term, so
we are just leaving the one in {\tt Q} alone and moving along.

  Now in {\bf A2} we have ${\tt ABC(P)} > {\tt ABC(Q)}$ (since
the latter is now 010, so we go to {\bf A5}.  This is adding a $x$ term to {\tt Q},
which doesn't have one.  So me make a new node {\tt Q2}, set it's {\tt COEF}
to 1, and it's {\tt ABC} to 010.  We then juggle pointers so that {\tt P} gets
moved along one to $+y$, and {\tt Q} now includes $+x$, and the {\tt Q}
pointers are moved along one (so that {\tt Q} still points at $-2y$ but {\tt Q1}
points at the new node).

Now we have both {\tt P} and {\tt Q} pointing at a {\tt COEF} 010 term ($y$),
so we go to {\bf A3} and add, updating the coefficient so that {\tt Q} now
has {\tt COEF} -1 for $y$.  Then we move {\tt P} along to $+z$, {\tt Q}
along to $-z$, and {\tt Q1} to the $y$ term.

Again they match, but this time when we add we get {\tt COEF} 0 and so go to
{\bf A4}.  We remove the node by making the {\tt LINK} of {\tt Q1} (which is
parked on $y$) point to {\tt LINK(Q)}, which points at the terminal node,
and have {\tt Q} point to the terminal node.  {\tt P} is also moved along, also
to its terminal node.  Since {\tt P} and {\tt Q} are both at their terminal node,
we end up at {\bf A3} with ${\tt ABC(P)} < 0$, and so we terminate.  
The sum is $x^2 + x - y$.
